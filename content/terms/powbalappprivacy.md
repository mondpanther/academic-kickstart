# POWBAL Privacy Notice

These Terms are an agreement between you and Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, a University incorporated by Royal Charter in the United Kingdom whose address is at South Kensington Campus, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2AZ (“Imperial”).  When these Terms refer to “our”, “us” or “we”, they refer to Imperial.

Imperial is a partner in the POWBAL research project studying consumer energy use and has developed the POWBAL application (“the POWBAL App”).  The POWBAL App enables participants in the POWBAL research project to configure and operate a smart power plug (“the POWBAL Plug”) that connects via the participants’ home WIFI connection to the internet.  The POWBAL Plug allows remote switching-off of electrical devices connected to the plug as well as the measurement of those devices’ power consumption.  It also allows participants to override remote switch-offs of the POWBAL Plug by Imperial.

Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine., its affiliates and subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Imperial”) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes our practices in connection with information privacy on personal data we process through your individual use of the following services, products, and related mobile applications (collectively, the “Products”) including the POWBAL App developed by the POWBAL research project in which Imperial is a partner.

In this Privacy Notice, “Personal Data” means information that can be used to identify an individual, either from that information alone, or from that information and other information we have access to about that individual. “Smart Devices” refers to those nonstandard computing devices produced or manufactured by hardware manufacturers, with human-machine interface and the ability to transmit data that connect wirelessly to a network, including: smart home appliances, smart wearable devices, etc. “Apps” refers to those mobile applications developed by POWBAL that provide end users remote control to Smart Devices and the ability to connect to the POWBAL Web Platform.
